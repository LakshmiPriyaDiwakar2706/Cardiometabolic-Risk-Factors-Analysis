# Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Analysis in Nepal

## Project Overview
This project involved preprocessing and analyzing health survey data from over 10,000 adults in Nepal to identify critical factors influencing hypertension and obesity. Utilizing Python (Pandas, scikit-learn) for data analysis and R for statistical tests and regression analysis, we aimed to enhance policy formulation and guide targeted public health interventions.

## Findings and Conclusions
1. **Age and Gender**: 
   - Age and male gender emerged as significant predictors of hypertension, even after adjusting for lifestyle factors.
   
2. **BMI and Weight**:
   - Higher BMI and weight were associated with increased odds of hypertension, even after accounting for sociodemographic factors.
   
3. **Sociodemographic Factors**:
   - Marital status and education level showed mixed associations with hypertension, suggesting a need for further exploration into sociocultural determinants of hypertension risk.
   
4. **Gender, Age, and Education**:
   - Female gender, age, and lower education levels were significant predictors of obesity, even after adjusting for lifestyle factors.

## Implications
Understanding these predictors is crucial for developing targeted interventions and public health strategies to reduce the burden of cardiometabolic diseases. Our findings underscore the importance of multifaceted approaches, including lifestyle modifications, health education, and policy interventions, to address hypertension and obesity at both individual and population levels in Nepal.

## Recommendations
- **Targeted Interventions and Policies**: 
  - Develop specific interventions to address risk factors such as age, gender, BMI, and education level.
  
- **Collaborative Efforts**:
  - Encourage collaboration between healthcare professionals, policymakers, community leaders, and individuals to prevent and manage hypertension and obesity effectively.
  
- **Clinical Management and Public Health Strategies**:
  - Implement clinical management strategies and public health initiatives to mitigate chronic disease burdens and promote overall population health and well-being.

This project highlights the importance of comprehensive data analysis in informing public health decisions and strategies. By addressing the predictors of hypertension and obesity, we can make significant strides in improving health outcomes in Nepal.
